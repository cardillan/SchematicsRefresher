# Schematics Refresher

This Mindustry mod refreshes schematics stored in the `/schematics` subdirectory whenever the game loads or 
the **Refresh** button in the Schematics screen is used.

This mod is only useful if you modify these schematics externally, for example by building them using
[Mindcode](https://github.com/cardillan/mindcode).
