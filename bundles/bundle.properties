scripts.schematics-refresher.refresh = Refresh
scripts.schematics-refresher.refreshed = All schematics have been refreshed.\n\n\
  Note: refreshing schematics is useless unless the schematics in the [stat]/schematics[] subfolder \
  have been modified by an external process, \
  perhaps by downloading them from internet or by updating them using some schematics building tool.\n\n\
  One such tool is [stat]Mindcode[], a high level language compiler/schematics builder for Mindustry.\n
